- Token-based user authentication

**âœ… Phase 2: Voice & AI Integration**
- German voice command processing with OpenAI GPT
- Automatic task decomposition for large tasks
- Pattern-matching fallback for offline operation
- Enhanced API with voice-optimized endpoints

**âœ… Phase 3: Frontend Migration** 
- Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline support
- Static asset serving through Azure Functions
- Service worker for caching and background sync
- Complete removal of Next.js/React dependencies
