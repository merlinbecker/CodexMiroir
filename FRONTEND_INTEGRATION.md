# Frontend Integration Complete âœ…

## Summary

The frontend has been successfully integrated into the Azure Function app. The client UI is now served at the root route "/" while the API remains available at "/api/codex".

## What Was Done

### 1. Architecture Restructuring
- Split the single Azure Function into two functions:
  - `codex/` - Handles API requests at `/api/codex`
  - `static/` - Serves frontend assets at all other routes

### 2. Frontend Asset Integration
- Built frontend assets are automatically copied to the function directory
- Static file serving with proper MIME types and caching headers
- SPA routing support (fallback to index.html for client-side routes)

### 3. Configuration Updates
- `host.json`: Added `AZUREWEBJOBSDISABLEHOMEPAGE=true` to disable Azure's default homepage
- Route configuration: API at `/api/codex`, frontend at `/`

### 4. Automation
- Created `integrate-frontend.sh` script that:
  - Builds the frontend
  - Copies assets to Azure Function directory
  - Verifies the setup
  - Runs integration tests

## Progressive Web App Features

The frontend is now configured as a PWA with:
- âœ… Service Worker (`sw.js`)
- âœ… Web App Manifest (`manifest.json`)
- âœ… Proper meta tags for mobile devices
- âœ… Theme colors and app icons

## Deployment Instructions

### Local Development
1. Build and integrate: `./integrate-frontend.sh`
2. Test locally with Azure Functions Core Tools

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Deploy the function app
func azure functionapp publish codex-miroir-fn

# Configure environment variables
az functionapp config appsettings set \
  --name codex-miroir-fn \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --settings \
    "AZURE_BLOB_CONN=your-storage-connection-string" \
    "API_KEY=your-secure-api-key" \
    "AZUREWEBJOBSDISABLEHOMEPAGE=true"
```

## Access Points

After deployment:
- **Frontend**: `https://your-function-app.azurewebsites.net/`
- **API**: `https://your-function-app.azurewebsites.net/api/codex?action=...`

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Unified Deployment** - Single Azure resource hosts both frontend and backend
2. **Cost Optimization** - No separate static hosting costs
3. **Simplified Management** - One SSL certificate, one domain
4. **PWA Ready** - Full Progressive Web App support
5. **SPA Support** - Client-side routing works correctly
